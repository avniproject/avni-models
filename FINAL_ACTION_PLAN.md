## 🚀 Execution Options

### Option A: Automated (Recommended) ⚡

**Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Effort:** Minimal (script-driven)  
**Safety:** Maximum (built-in checks and rollback)

```bash
# Single command execution
bash execute-migration.sh
```

**Script will:**
1. Create git checkpoint
2. Run pre-migration audits
3. Show dry-run preview
4. **Pause for confirmation** ⏸️
5. Execute migration
6. Validate results
7. Run tests
8. **Pause for review** ⏸️
9. Commit changes
10. Create success tag

### Option B: Manual Step-by-Step 🔧

**Time:** ~30 minutes  
**Effort:** Hands-on control  
**Safety:** High (you control each step)

```bash
# Step 1: Backup
git add .
git commit -m "chore: checkpoint before Realm v12 migration"
git tag realm-schema-v11-baseline

# Step 2: Pre-flight checks
node schema-audit.js          # Expect: 0 critical issues
node check-breaking-changes.js # Note: 3 false positives, all safe

# Step 3: Dry run
node migrate-realm-schema.js  # Review: 36 files, 73 changes

# Step 4: Execute
node migrate-realm-schema.js --apply

# Step 5: Validate
node validate-schemas.js      # Should pass with 0 errors

# Step 6: Test
npm run build                 # Should succeed
npm test                      # Should pass

# Step 7: Review & Commit
git diff --stat               # Review changes
git diff                      # Detailed review
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate Realm schemas to v12 syntax

- Update 36 schema files with 73 property definitions
- Convert object references to explicit v12 format
- All schemas validated and tests passing

BREAKING CHANGE: Requires Realm v12+ in consuming applications"

git tag realm-schema-v12-migrated
```

### Option C: Super Safe (Extra Validation) 🛡️

Add extra validation steps:

```bash
# After Step 3 (dry run), manually inspect key files
git diff HEAD:src/Settings.js <(node migrate-realm-schema.js --apply --dry-run 2>/dev/null | grep Settings.js -A 5)

# After migration, spot-check critical files
cat src/Settings.js | grep -A 2 "locale:"
cat src/Individual.js | grep -A 2 "gender:"
cat src/Individual.js | grep -A 2 "subjectType:"

# Run additional validation
npm run prettier-all  # Format check
npm run build         # Full build
npm test              # Full test suite
```

  - **Option B:** Minor bump (1.32.54 → 1.33.0) - Only if backward compatible
- [ ] Run version bump: `npm version major -m "BREAKING: Realm v12 schema syntax"`
- [ ] Verify package.json updated
- [ ] Test package build: `npm pack`

### Publishing (Day 3-5)

- [ ] Test with consuming app (avni-client)
- [ ] Verify consuming app can upgrade

  ```bash
  rm schema-audit.js check-breaking-changes.js validate-schemas.js
  rm execute-migration.sh migration-baseline.txt
  ```
- [ ] Keep documentation:
  ```bash
  # Keep these for reference

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

If anything goes wrong:

### Immediate Rollback

```bash
# Revert to pre-migration state
git reset --hard realm-schema-v11-baseline

# Verify rollback
git log --oneline -1
npm run build
npm test
```

### Partial Rollback (Fix Specific Files)

npm test
```

### Post-Publish Rollback

```bash
# Unpublish problematic version (within 72 hours)
npm unpublish openchs-models@2.0.0

# Publish patched version
git revert HEAD
npm version patch
npm publish
```

## ⚠️ Critical Considerations

### Breaking Change Impact

**This IS a breaking change for:**
- ✅ Apps using this package with Realm v11 or earlier
- ✅ They MUST upgrade to Realm v12+ to use new version

**This is NOT a breaking change for:**
- ✅ Schema logic or data structure
- ✅ API surface of models
- ✅ Method signatures or exports

### Version Strategy Decision

**Recommended: Major Version (2.0.0)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clearly signals breaking change
- ✅ Follows semantic versioning
- ✅ Forces consuming apps to explicitly upgrade
- ✅ Prevents accidental breaking

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May slow adoption
- ⚠️ Requires coordination with consumers

**Alternative: Minor Version (1.33.0)**

**Only if:**
- Realm v12 is backward compatible with these schema definitions
- All consuming apps already on Realm v12
- Team agrees minor bump is acceptable

**Our Recommendation:** Use **2.0.0** to be safe and clear.

   - ✅ Share this plan with app teams
   - ✅ Confirm they can upgrade Realm
   - ✅ Agree on timeline

2. **During Migration (Day 1):**
   - ✅ Notify teams migration is in progress
   - ✅ Share expected timeline

3. **Post-Migration (Day 2-3):**
   - ✅ Share migration completion
   - ✅ Provide realm-upgrade-sop.sh for their apps
   - ✅ Offer migration support

4. **Pre-Publish (Day 3-5):**
   - ✅ Test with at least one consuming app
   - ✅ Document any issues discovered
   - ✅ Get sign-off before publishing
